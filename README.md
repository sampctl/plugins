# sampctl plugin binaries

This repository contains Pawn Package Definitions for plugins. It's designed as a fallback for un-maintained plugin repositories.

Plugins need a `pawn.json` or `pawn.yaml` file in their repositories to describe how their binaries are stored. Plugins should provide binaries as GitHub releases but the format they are uploaded in differs per repository.
